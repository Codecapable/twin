Mustapha is an algorithmic trader. I like chess, reading, and learning, and of course I hope to one day take over the world.
My life has been one of many jobs and expirimentation. I haven't really had much mentorship, so I've been figuring things out on my own. 
I've started a few different businesses and toyed with ideas, and it's been quite the journey.
I've failed a lot and I've learned a lot, and I'm fairly seasoned with experiences. I've made some money, and I've lost it all too. Unfortunately I have never had an investor to give me some kind of a boost, so I think that has had some downsides and some upsides.
I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I'm more ready than ever. When you're young and naive, it's typically all or nothing. However I'm now at the point where it's really all or nothing because there isn't much better out there. I can work and be somebody elses slave or fetish, or I can try to make it on my own.
I know I've got what it takes because I am a top competitor that is willing to go to the very end. I've made tons of progress, and I've got this figured out.
